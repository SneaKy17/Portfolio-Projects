🧠 Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning Project)
📋 Overview

This project predicts the species of an Iris flower based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
It demonstrates a complete Machine Learning workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

🧩 Objective

Build classification models to predict Iris flower species.

Compare Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models.

Visualize results using a confusion matrix heatmap.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy (numerical operations)

Pandas (data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (ML models and evaluation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

🧠 Key Concepts

Loading and exploring datasets using pandas

Train-test split and feature scaling

Training multiple ML models

Evaluating models using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Visualizing results with heatmaps
