# iris-flower-classification.
📋 Overview

This project predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
It uses two popular Machine Learning algorithms — Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to compare their performance and understand basic ML workflows.

🧩 Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately identify the type of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using Python and Scikit-learn.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Key Concepts

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Training and testing ML models

Model evaluation using accuracy score and classification report

Comparing algorithm performance (Logistic Regression vs KNN)

📊 Results
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	~97%
K-Nearest Neighbors	~100% (depending on random state)

🏆 KNN performed slightly better on the test dataset in most runs.

📈 Sample Output
📊 Model Accuracy Comparison:
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.97
KNN Accuracy: 1.00

🏆 K-Nearest Neighbors performed better!
